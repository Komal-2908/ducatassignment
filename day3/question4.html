       <h4> <p>Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?,,<br>

            Thou art more lovely and more temperate.<br>
            
            Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br>
            
            And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.<br>
            
            Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br>
            
            And often is his gold complexion dimmed;<br>
            
            And every fair from fair sometime declines,<br>
            
            By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;<br>
            
            But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<br>
            
            Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,<br>
            
            Nor shall death brag thou wand’rest in his shade,<br>
            
            When in eternal lines to Time thou grow’st.<br>
            
            So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,<br>
            
            So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.<br>
