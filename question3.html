        <h1><center>Healthy Habbits For Me</center></h1>
        <h3><em><U>Eat healthy food</U> </em><br><p><strong>There is a simple rule that what and how you eat is directly proportional to your health. The habit of eating healthy food will help you to maintain good and disease-free health. Your regular diet should include different fruits, green leafy vegetables, sprouts, pulses, meat, poultry food, and seafood. Your diet should be high in protein, fibers, vitamins, minerals, and low in carbohydrates and calories.  

            Also, how you eat or chew your food is also an important part. You have to chew your food 20-30 times to make it digestible.</strong>  </p></h3>
             <h3><em><u>Stay hydrated</u></em><br><p><strong> Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Aim for eight glasses of water per day, but more may be needed depending on your activity level and climate.</strong>
             </p></h3> <h3><em> <u>Get Regular exercise</u></em><br><p><strong>Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. Exercise helps to improve your physical and mental health.</strong></p></h3><h3><em><u> Get enough sleep</u></em><p><strong>Most adults need around 7-8 hours of sleep per night. Sleep is essential for overall health and well-being.</strong></p></h3>
